0.31   2006-10-22

- Added era_name() and era_abbreviation() methods for the use of
  DateTime.pm.


0.30   2006-10-22

- Now using the CLDR data instead of ICU. This isn't a big change,
  since the ICU data was derived from the CLDR data anyway.

- Based on CLDR 1.4.

* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY - Integrated the ISO639-2 aliases into
  DateTime::LocaleCatalog, and removed
  DateTime::Locale::Alias::ISO639_2.

- The data now include both abbreviated and long forms for eras. The
  eras() method continues to return the abbreviated forms, but this is
  deprecated. Use era_abbreviations() or era_names() instead.

- Added a STORABLE_attach method for integration with newer versions
  of Storable which provide better support for singletons.

- The narrow versions of days and months was not available for most
  locales, even though every locale should provide at least the
  default values for these items.


0.22   2005-05-31

- Allow id names passed to load() to contain dashes or underscores, in
  order to support RFC 3066 locale names, which use dashes.

- Fix bugs when a custom locale was registered and a "class" parameter
  was passed to register().  Patch from Yann Kerhervé.

- Switched to a "traditional" Makefile.PL file at Perrin Harkins'
  request.


0.21   2005-02-28

- Fix era() method for year 0.


0.20   2005-02-26

* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY - The way DateTime::Locale::Base
  subclasses work has changed.  Subclasses should no longer implement
  the date_formats() or time_formats() methods.  Instead, they need to
  provide one method per format length (full_date_format(),
  long_date_format(), etc).

- Uses much newer (August, 2004) data from ICU.  This includes a
  number of new locales.  See DateTime::LocaleCatalog for a list.
  This new data also adds a new type of differentiator for locales,
  the script (Latin vs Cyrillic, for example).

- Added new methods to get the "narrow" forms of a day or month.

- Implemented per-locale eras.

- Fix a number of doc typos and buglets.  Patch by Jean Forget.


0.09   2004-03-09

- Added Storable freeze & thaw hooks.

0.08   2004-02-12

- No code changes, just a Makefile.PL update to work with
  Module::Build 0.23.


0.07   2003-12-14

- If given an id like 'en_US.UTF-8', DateTime::Locale would die with
  the message 'Can't locate object method "_load_from_id" via package
  "DateTime::Locale" at /usr/share/perl5/DateTime/Locale.pm line 220'.
  Reported by Sylvain Daubert.


0.06   2003-12-08

- The DateTime::Locale docs now includes docs for all the methods that
  a locale object has.


0.05   2003-10-03

- Really make the documentation and code match!  This time there are
  even tests for this.  Reported by David Hood (again).

- DateTime::Locale won't try to load a class if it already has a new()
  method.  This is so you can define multiple locale subclasses in one
  file and load that file yourself before calling the load() method.


0.04   2003-10-03

- The documentation incorrectly showed the DateTime::Locale->register
  method as taking an array, rather than an array of hash references.
  Reported by David Hood.


0.03   2003-08-06

- Once a locale is loaded, it is cached in memory, so that locale
  objects are singletons.  Calling methods that change the locale
  registry, like register() or remove_alias(), clear that cache.  This
  should provide a noticeable speed boost when constructing many
  DateTime objects with the same locale.  Based on a patch from John
  Siracusa.


0.02   2003-07-25

- Make sure tests pass without requiring DateTime 0.14 to be
  installed.  Reported by Claus Farber.

- Document default formats and format lengths in
  DateTime::Locale::Base.


0.01   2003-07-23

- Initial release
